Registry settings for Windows XP, which have to be set after its install.
For me :  these .reg and .bat files are intended to be launched one by one, right after a fresh Windows XP has been installed.
For others :  review them all, take a necessary ones, modify as required.
Because :  there is only a small probability, that you want your next language to be set Russian, and there is a very big probability, that you don't want that your country would be chosen as Lithuania :)

*
Folder "counter" consists of some scripts, which work in a counter direction.
Folder "data" consists of files which can't be used directly, but are used through other .bat files.
Keyboard layout switching must be modified for .DEFAULT, instead of current, but it isn't :/ (it has to be done before our user is being created, thus, that it would be created with those, preferenced settings)

Folders :
"1" - contains scripts which have to be launched before other ones (do computer restart after using them).
"2" - most of scripts.
"3" - region-specific ones.
"4" - require additional registreable COM DLL to be used (DLL and its source are applied).

default_non-unicode_rus.bat - <self explainable>
keyboard_en_ru_lt.bat - setup input languages
power_options.bat - <self explainable>

automatic_updates_off.reg - disable windows updates
cdrom_autorun_off.reg - <self explainable> (note :  the "AutoRun" value is of DWORD type, not of STRING; if put there a string "0", the autorun will still work (for example :  Windows installation disk will make the first entry of popup menu to be "AutoPlay", and it will be in bold (default action), instead of normal "Open" entry))
classic_control_panel.reg - <self explainable>
delete_device_mounts.reg - when want to copy Windows XP onto another device or partition
desktop_icons_rearrange_off.reg - <self explainable> *don't use it, it will lock the quick launch panel.

keyboard_delay_0.reg - set minimal keyboard delay before repeat
keyboard_speed_31.reg - set maximal keyboard repeat ratio
layout_hotkeys.reg - setup keyboard layout switch hotkeys
layout_toggle_off.reg - disable Alt+Shift and Ctrl+Shift for toggling between layout (toggling is a very disturbing function - very inconvenient in use; use a hotkeys instead to switch between layouts; this .reg has to be applied after "keyboard_xx_yy.bat", otherwise its effect will be superseded)
max_cached_icons_2000.reg - <self explainable>
mouse_acceleration_off.reg - turn off "Enhance pointer precision"
mouse_pointer_speed.reg - <self explainable>
my_country_lt.reg - set my location

NoDriveTypeAutorun_ff.reg - disables autorun from devices
NoDriveTypeAutorun_ffffffff.reg - same, but also disables autorun of a network drive being connected (warning, "Autorun" still stays the primary selection for that drive)
NoStrCmpLogical_on.reg - changes the way an items in a folder view are sorted

recycle_bin_100_percent.reg - set Recycle Bin parameters
screen_saver_off.reg - <self explainable>

show_file_extension.reg - <self explainable>
start_menu_small_icons.reg - <self explainable>
WaitToKillServiceTimeout_20.reg - for the case if you wish to use Windows XP on a Pentium 2 and slower computers, you have to widen this value from the normal one

classic_desktop.vbs - <self explainable>
folder_view_list.vbs - change folder view from Icons to List
power_buttons_off.vbs - change power button actions to "Do nothing"
recycle_bin_no_confirmation.vbs - don't ask for confirmation when I delete a file

unattend.txt - unattended installation of WinXP.
For CD installation, it has to be renamed to "winnt.sif", and placed into "I386" directory.
Put CD-key into it, as a value for "ProductID".
*that file actually didn't work for me, and there also is nothing important in it, except that I expected that Win installer will not ask me for attention, when this file is available for it.

"quick_launch_x_rows.reg"
Will not work, because those values will be updated at the exit from explorer.
Apply them, forceably stop the explorer, and restart it again (stop and start can be done from Windows Task Manager, or from a batch script).



After that, change also :
[none]



Some helpful posts of "mr_unreliable" were used in creation of VBScripts.
