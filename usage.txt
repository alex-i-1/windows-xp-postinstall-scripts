Download all scripts.
Read/check the content of each (at least that they don't do some extra stuff which you wouldn't expect from them to do).
Choose the ones you need.

Since many of these scripts are touching important settings of the OS, they represent some potential danger when used.
It is better to use them right after the OS is installed; it is when you don't care much about any possible damage to OS because you may freely reinstall it again.
The threat although isn't big, and mostly consists of :  the old settings are not being backed up (and thus you will just lose them), the new non-default settins (which were not present) might be added, some items might be deleted (like some trash you might see in start menu (*that's not implemented at this moment)).

Some scripts did require to be run in a specific order, and that's why there are folders with a number names on them.
I am though still unsure which particular script is colliding with some other one, thus the numbering is left for testing.
But otherwise this numeration is meaningless.
